Description: Fits a functional mediation model with a scalar distal outcome.  The method is similar to that of Lindquist (2012) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2012.695640> although allowing a binary outcome as an alternative to a numerical outcome.  The development of this package was part of a research project supported by National Institutes of Health grants P50 DA039838 from the National Institute of Drug Abuse and 1R01 CA229542-01 from the National Cancer Institute and the NIH Office of Behavioral and Social Science Research.
