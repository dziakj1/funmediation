Description: Fits a functional mediation model with a scalar distal outcome. The method is described in detail by Coffman, Dziak, Litson, Chakraborti, Piper & Li (2021) <arXiv:2112.03960>. The model is similar to that of Lindquist (2012) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2012.695640> although allowing a binary outcome as an alternative to a numerical outcome.  The current version is a minor bug fix in the vignette.
